# Brainstorming Session 🧠

Welcome! This is your space for free-form idea exploration.

## How this works:

- **No bad ideas** - Everything is worth exploring
- **I'll help expand** - I'll build on your ideas
- **We'll capture everything** - Nothing gets lost
- **End with a mind map** - Visual summary of our session

## What would you like to explore?

Pick a mode or just start talking:

[W] **Wild Ideas** - No constraints, pure creativity
[F] **Focused** - Deep dive on a specific topic  
[C] **Compare** - Analyze different options

Or just tell me what's on your mind! What aspect of your game are you thinking about?
