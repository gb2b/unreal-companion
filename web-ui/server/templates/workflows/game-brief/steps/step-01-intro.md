# Let's Create Your Game Brief! 📋

A game brief is your North Star - it captures your vision in a clear, shareable document.

## What We'll Cover

1. **Core Concept** - Name, pitch, genre
2. **Pillars** - The 3-4 core promises of your game
3. **References** - Inspirations and what makes you unique
4. **Target** - Audience, platforms, scope

## Why It Matters

A good game brief:
- Keeps your team aligned
- Helps you say "no" to feature creep
- Makes pitching easier
- Is your reference when you're lost
