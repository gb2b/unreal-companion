# Let's Create Your Game Brief! 🎮

The Game Brief is your game's north star - a document that captures the essence of what you're building and why.

## What we'll define together:

1. **Identity** - Name, tagline, elevator pitch
2. **Vision** - The emotional experience you want to create
3. **Core Pillars** - 3-5 fundamental principles
4. **References** - Games that inspire you
5. **Audience** - Who you're making this for
6. **Scope** - Realistic boundaries

## Why this matters:

A solid Game Brief helps:
- Keep the team aligned on vision
- Make tough decisions consistently
- Pitch to publishers/investors
- Stay focused during development
