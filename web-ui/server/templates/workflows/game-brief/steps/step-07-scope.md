# Scope & Constraints 📏

Dreams are free. Shipping is hard. Let's be realistic.

## The MVP

What absolutely MUST be in the first playable version? Be ruthless.

A good MVP:
- Proves the core loop is fun
- Can be built in reasonable time
- Tests the riskiest assumptions

## Nice-to-Have

What would make 1.0 great but isn't essential?

## Out of Scope

This is CRITICAL. What are you explicitly NOT doing?

Say no to:
- Features that don't serve pillars
- Scope that exceeds your resources
- "Cool ideas" that distract from core

Scope discipline is the difference between shipped and abandoned.
