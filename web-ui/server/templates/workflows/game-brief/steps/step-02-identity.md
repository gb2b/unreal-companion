# Game Identity 🏷️

Let's nail down who your game is.

## The Name

What's your game called? Don't worry if it's a working title - we can always change it later.

## The Tagline

In 10 words or less, what's the hook? Think of taglines like:
- "Every death makes you stronger" (Hades)
- "Fear the old blood" (Bloodborne)
- "Would you kindly?" (BioShock)

## The Elevator Pitch

You have 30 seconds with a publisher. What do you say?

Structure: "In [Name], you play as [who] doing [what]. The core experience is [feeling]. Think [reference] meets [reference]."
