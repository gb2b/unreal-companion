# Core Pillars 🏛️

Pillars are the non-negotiable principles that guide every decision.

## What are Pillars?

They're the rules you never break. When facing a tough design decision, pillars help you choose.

## Examples from real games:

**Hades:**
1. "Every run tells a story"
2. "Death is progress, not failure"
3. "Combat should feel musical"

**Breath of the Wild:**
1. "See it? Go there"
2. "Multiple solutions to every problem"
3. "Chemistry-based interactions"

## Your Pillars

Define 3-5 principles. Start with the most important.

If a feature doesn't support at least one pillar, question if it belongs.
