# References & Inspirations 🎯

Standing on the shoulders of giants!

## Why references matter:

- They give you a shared vocabulary with your team
- They help identify what works and what doesn't
- They set expectations for scope and quality

## Your main references

Which games most inspire this project? I'll suggest some based on your genre, but add any others!

## What to take

Be specific! "I love Hades" isn't useful. "I love how Hades makes death feel like progress through story advancement" is.

## What to avoid

Equally important: what DON'T you want from these games?

Being specific here saves tons of confusion later.
