# Core Gameplay 🔄

The loop is everything. Let's nail it.

## The Core Loop

Every great game has a satisfying loop:
- **Fortnite**: Land → Loot → Fight → Repeat
- **Hades**: Run → Die → Story → Upgrade → Repeat  
- **Stardew**: Wake → Farm → Socialize → Sleep → Repeat

What's yours?

## Session Structure

Walk me through a typical play session:
- How does it start?
- What's the flow?
- How does it end?

## Player Actions

What verbs define your gameplay?
- Move, Jump, Shoot?
- Build, Craft, Trade?
- Talk, Explore, Solve?

## Feedback

How does the player know they're doing well?
- Visual effects?
- Sound design?
- Numbers and scores?
