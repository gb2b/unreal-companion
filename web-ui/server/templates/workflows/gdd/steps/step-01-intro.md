# Game Design Document 📖

The GDD is your comprehensive design blueprint.

## Before We Start

This workflow works best when you have a **Game Brief** ready. 

I see you have: {{#if game_brief}}✅ Game Brief loaded{{else}}❌ No Game Brief found - consider creating one first{{/if}}

## What We'll Cover

1. **Overview** - High-level vision review
2. **Gameplay** - Core loop and moment-to-moment
3. **Mechanics** - Detailed systems design
4. **Progression** - How players grow
5. **Content** - Levels, enemies, items
6. **UI/UX** - Interface and experience
7. **Art & Audio** - Visual and sound direction
8. **Technical** - Performance and platform needs

## Time Commitment

Expect 2-4 hours for a first pass. You can always come back!
