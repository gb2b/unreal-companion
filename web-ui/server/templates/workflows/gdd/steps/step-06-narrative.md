# Narrative Design 📖

Even puzzle games have world-building. What's your story?

## Story (if applicable)

Not every game needs a plot, but if yours does:
- What's the beginning state?
- What's the conflict?
- What's the resolution?

## World Setting

Where and when does this take place?
- Time period
- Location
- Tone/atmosphere
- Rules of the world

## Characters

Who does the player meet?
- Player character
- Allies
- Antagonists
- NPCs

## Narrative Delivery

How do players experience the story?
- Cutscenes (expensive but cinematic)
- Dialogue (flexible)
- Environmental (subtle but powerful)
- Lore items (optional depth)

Story serves gameplay, not the other way around.
