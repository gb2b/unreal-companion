# You're All Set! 🎉

Your project brief has been created!

## What's Next?

Now that we have the basics, here are some paths forward:

1. **💡 Brainstorming** - Explore your ideas in depth
2. **📋 Game Brief** - Create a detailed vision document
3. **🎮 Start Building** - Jump straight into Unreal Engine
4. **💬 Chat** - Just talk through your ideas with me

## Your Project Brief

I've saved your quick start info to `output/concept/project-brief.md`.

You can always come back and expand this with the **Game Brief** workflow when you're ready.

Let's make something awesome! 🚀
