# Welcome to Quick Start! 🚀

Let's get your project set up in just 2 minutes.

I'll ask you a few quick questions to create your project-context.md - the central document that helps all AI tools understand your game.

## What we'll cover:
1. **Game name** - What's your project called?
2. **Core concept** - One sentence about your game
3. **Genre & inspiration** - Quick genre and references

Ready? Let's go!

**What's your game called?** (Working title is fine!)
