# Sprint Goals 🎯

Now let's define what success looks like.

## Sprint Duration

How long do you have? This affects how ambitious we can be.

## Main Goal

Every sprint needs ONE clear main goal. What's the most important thing to achieve?

Good examples:
- "Have a playable vertical slice"
- "Complete the combat system"
- "Fix all critical bugs before demo"

## Secondary Goals

These are nice-to-haves if time permits.

Focus is key - one clear goal is better than five vague ones!
