# Art & Audio 🎨🎵

How does your game look and sound?

## Art Style

Be specific about:
- 2D or 3D?
- Realistic or stylized?
- Color palette
- Visual influences

Examples: "Hand-painted 2D like Hollow Knight" or "Low-poly 3D with a neon palette"

## Visual References

- Games
- Films/animation
- Artists/illustrators

## Audio Direction

Sound is 50% of the experience!
- Music style/genre
- Sound effects approach
- Voice acting (if any)

## UI/UX

How should interfaces feel?
- Diegetic (in-world)?
- Minimal/clean?
- Stylized to match art?
