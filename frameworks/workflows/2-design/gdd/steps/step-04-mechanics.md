# Game Mechanics ⚙️

Time to get into the details of HOW it plays.

## Primary Mechanics

These are the systems players interact with most. For each:
- What is it?
- How does it work?
- Why is it fun?

Example (for a roguelike):
**Combat System**
- What: Real-time action combat with dodge and attack
- How: Light/heavy attacks, dodge with i-frames, combo strings
- Why: Mastery feels rewarding, every enemy is a puzzle

## Secondary Mechanics

What supports the primary mechanics?
- Economy systems
- Inventory management
- Environmental interactions

## Controls

Map out the control scheme. Consider:
- Primary actions (most used)
- Secondary actions
- Modifiers

## Rules

What constraints define the game?
- Health/lives system?
- Time limits?
- Resource scarcity?

Be specific! Vague mechanics lead to vague games.
