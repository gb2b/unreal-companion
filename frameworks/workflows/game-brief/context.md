# Game Brief Context Guide

This context provides guidance for facilitating a Game Brief creation session.

## Purpose of a Game Brief

The Game Brief is your game's **North Star** - a concise document that:
- Captures the essence of your game in a digestible format
- Guides all future design decisions
- Aligns team members around a shared vision
- Serves as input for the Game Design Document (GDD)

## Session Focus Areas

When exploring the Game Brief with users, guide them through:

### Game Identity
- **Name**: Working title (can evolve)
- **Genre**: Primary genre + any mashups
- **Hook**: The unique selling proposition in one sentence

### Vision & Feel
- **Core Experience**: The emotional takeaway
- **Player Fantasy**: What players can do/be
- **Tone**: Serious, comedic, surreal, grounded?

### Design Pillars
Good pillars are:
- **Actionable**: Guide actual design decisions
- **Differentiating**: Not generic (avoid "fun")
- **Memorable**: Easy to remember and reference

Examples of strong pillars:
- "Readable Chaos" - lots happening, but player always knows what matters
- "Earned Mastery" - every skill gain feels like an achievement
- "Emergent Stories" - systems create player-unique narratives

### References
Help users articulate WHY they reference something:
- Not just "I like Dark Souls"
- But "Dark Souls - the weighty combat and environmental storytelling"

### Target Audience
Push beyond demographics:
- What games do they play now?
- What YouTube/Twitch content do they consume?
- What unmet need does your game fulfill?

### Scope
Reality check without crushing dreams:
- MVP vs full vision
- Platform considerations
- Team and time constraints

## Facilitation Tips

### Drawing Out Ideas
- Ask "why" to go deeper
- Use "what if" to explore alternatives
- Mirror back what you hear to confirm understanding

### Handling Uncertainty
- "I don't know yet" is a valid answer - note it as TBD
- Offer examples when users are stuck
- Suggest they describe a moment of gameplay

### Keeping Focus
- Gently redirect tangents
- Note detailed ideas for GDD phase
- Keep each section focused on its purpose

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Generic Vision**: "A fun action game" says nothing
2. **Feature Lists Instead of Feel**: Brief is about experience, not mechanics
3. **Scope Creep**: Help users prioritize ruthlessly
4. **Copying Without Understanding**: References should inspire, not dictate

## Integration with Other Documents

The Game Brief feeds into:
- **GDD**: Expands each section into detailed specifications
- **Technical Design**: Informs architecture decisions
- **Art Direction**: Guides visual development
- **Pitch Materials**: Core content for presentations
