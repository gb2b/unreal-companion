# Target Audience 👥

You can't make a game for everyone. Who is this for?

## Your Player

Describe your ideal player. What games do they already play? What are they looking for?

## Play Context

Understanding WHEN and HOW they play shapes everything:
- A commuter wants quick sessions
- A weekend gamer wants deep experiences
- A parent wants pause-friendly design

## Platforms

Where will they play? This affects:
- Control schemes
- Session length expectations
- Performance targets
- Business model

It's okay to be niche! Better to be loved by few than ignored by many.
