# Prioritization 📊

Not all tasks are equal. Let's sort them.

## Must-Have Tasks

These are critical for sprint success. If these aren't done, the sprint fails.

## Nice-to-Have

These would be great to complete but aren't blocking.

## Dependencies

Some tasks need others to be done first:
- "Can't test combat until damage system is done"
- "Art needs final designs before modeling"

Be honest about priorities - it's better to finish fewer tasks well than to half-finish everything!
