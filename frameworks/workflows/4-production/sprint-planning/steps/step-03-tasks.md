# Breaking it down 🔧

Let's turn those goals into specific tasks.

## Your Task List

List all the tasks you can think of to achieve your sprint goal.

Tips for good tasks:
- **Specific**: "Implement player jump" not "Work on movement"
- **Actionable**: Something you can actually do
- **Estimable**: You can roughly guess the effort

## AI Assistance

I can help identify tasks you might have missed based on:
- Your project context
- Common game dev patterns
- Dependencies between features
