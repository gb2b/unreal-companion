# Let's plan your sprint! 📋

First, let's understand where you are.

## Recent Progress

What have you accomplished since the last sprint (or recently)?
This helps me suggest relevant next steps.

## Current Blockers

Are there any challenges or blockers we should consider?
Technical debt, unclear designs, waiting for assets...

Don't worry if you don't have a previous sprint - we'll work with what you have!
