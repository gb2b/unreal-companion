# Memory System

## Loading Memories

At the start of each session, read `{{project_path}}/.unreal-companion/memories.yaml`.
Use these memories as context for all responses.

## Memory Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/memories` | List all memories |
| `/memory add "..."` | Add a new memory |
| `/memory remove <id>` | Remove memory by ID |
| `/memory clear` | Clear all (with confirmation) |

## Auto-Propose Memories

When you detect important information about:
- The game concept, genre, or mechanics
- Technical constraints or preferences
- User communication preferences
- Key decisions made during conversations

Propose to save it:

```
💾 **Retenir ?** "info détectée"
→ [y] Oui  [n] Non  [e] Modifier
```

If user confirms with 'y', append to memories.yaml:

```yaml
project:
  - id: "m{{timestamp}}"
    content: "info détectée"
    source: "conversation"
    created: "{{date}}"
```

If user wants to modify with 'e', ask for the corrected version before saving.

## Memory File Format

```yaml
version: "1.0"
last_updated: "{{date}}"

project:
  - id: "m1"
    content: "Memory content here"
    source: "workflow name or conversation"
    created: "{{date}}"

agents:
  game-designer:
    - id: "gd1"
      content: "Agent-specific memory"
      source: "brainstorming"
      created: "{{date}}"
```

## Important Info to Remember

- Project concept and genre
- Target platforms and performance requirements
- User's preferred language for communication
- User's preferred language for documents

## Reading Memories

When loading memories, present a brief summary:
"📚 Loaded X memories: [brief topics]"

Don't list all memories unless asked with `/memories`.
