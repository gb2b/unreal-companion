# BMGD Framework

This project uses the Unreal Companion Studio for AI-assisted game development.

## Quick Start

1. **Read the project index**: `.unreal-companion/COMPANION.md`
2. **Check current tasks**: `.unreal-companion/docs/.companion/tasks.json`
3. **Adopt an agent** for specialized help

## Agents

Reference agents with `@bmgd/agents/{name}`:

- **game-dev** - Implementation, coding, debugging
- **game-designer** - Mechanics, balance, player experience  
- **game-architect** - Technical architecture, systems design
- **game-qa** - Testing, quality, bug tracking

## Workflows

Reference workflows with `@bmgd/workflows/{name}`:

- **quick-prototype** (5 min) - Define a game idea rapidly
- **game-brief** (30 min) - Complete game brief document
- **gdd** (1-2h) - Full Game Design Document
- **game-architecture** - Technical architecture design

## Directory Structure

```
.unreal-companion/
├── COMPANION.md          # Start here
├── config.json           # Project config
├── docs/
│   ├── concept/          # Briefs, prototypes
│   ├── design/           # GDD, mechanics
│   ├── technical/        # Architecture, specs
│   ├── production/       # Sprints, planning
│   └── .companion/
│       └── tasks.json    # Task board
└── .cursor/rules/bmgd/   # This folder
```

## Creating Documents

When creating docs:
1. Use the appropriate folder (concept/, design/, technical/, production/)
2. Use markdown format
3. Update COMPANION.md after creating important documents

## Web UI

For visual interface: http://localhost:8000

The web UI provides:
- Today Dashboard with AI suggestions
- Production Board (visual task management)
- Workflow Wizard (guided document creation)
- Document viewer
