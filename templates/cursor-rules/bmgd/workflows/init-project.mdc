# Workflow: Initialize Project

This workflow sets up Unreal Companion for a new or existing Unreal Engine project.

## When to Use

- First time using Companion with this project
- Want to enable AI-assisted development features
- Need to set up docs structure and task board

## Steps

### Step 1: Locate the .uproject file

Ask the user for the path to their `.uproject` file.

**Question**: What's the path to your Unreal project file (.uproject)?

Examples:
- `/Users/dev/UnrealProjects/MyGame/MyGame.uproject`
- `C:\Projects\MyGame\MyGame.uproject`

### Step 2: Verify the path

Before proceeding, verify:
1. The file exists
2. It ends with `.uproject`
3. It's a valid JSON file (Unreal project format)

### Step 3: Initialize via API

Call the initialization endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/projects/init \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"uproject_path": "/path/to/MyGame.uproject"}'
```

Or if you have direct file access, the initialization creates:

```
.unreal-companion/
├── config.json           # Project configuration
├── COMPANION.md          # Project index (START HERE)
├── AGENTS.md             # Instructions for Claude Code
├── CLAUDE.md             # Instructions for Claude Desktop
├── docs/
│   ├── concept/          # Game briefs, prototypes
│   ├── design/           # GDD, mechanics
│   ├── technical/        # Architecture, specs
│   ├── production/       # Sprints, planning
│   └── .companion/
│       └── tasks.json    # Task board
└── .cursor/rules/bmgd/   # Cursor rules
    └── index.mdc
```

### Step 4: Confirm success

After initialization:
1. Read `.unreal-companion/COMPANION.md` to verify
2. The project is now registered globally
3. It will appear in the Web UI at http://localhost:8000

### Step 5: Next steps

Suggest to the user:

1. **Quick Prototype** (5 min) - Define your game idea
   → Run `@bmgd/workflows/quick-prototype`

2. **Game Brief** (30 min) - Complete game brief
   → Run `@bmgd/workflows/game-brief`

3. **Check Web UI** - Visual interface
   → Open http://localhost:8000
